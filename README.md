# PenClassification

Trained a neural network to classify pen images into three different categories as follows, 
1. Ball point pen
2. Ink pens
3. Markers

Created a dataset consisting of 400+ images of pens. The images collected online were of different shapes. Therefore all these images were  reshaped to 50 x 50 pixels. The images were also converted to grayscale.

Data pre-processing was done in python. Neural network training was done in R using the H2O library.
